# Tools and Resources
Are you wondering what tools and resources I use for my job? On this page, I share a list of tools, products, services, and resources I use. Feel anything is missing? Let us know and I’ll update the list.

# Graphics:
Everything I use to create graphics.

# Network Diagrams:
I use Microsoft Visio 2019 to create all network diagrams. Stencils are from Visiocafe (http://www.visiocafe.com), they release a lot of good-looking free Visio stencils (http://www.visiocafe.com/vsdfx.htm). I use Excalidraw for quick drawings.

# Tools
A collection of miscellaneous tools.

# Terminal:
Nowadays, I use SecureCRT as my main console/terminal with the Consolas font (https://freefontsdownload.net/free-consolas-font-33098.htm). SecureCRT might look outdated but does everything you need. There are two main reasons why I use it:

* The session manager is useful to store all devices you connect to.
* It supports scripts. I use this sometimes to extract configurations from devices.

Also You can use this nice words file (Special thanks to Giulino Barros):
* 1 - Download files "Cisco Words.ini" or "Cisco Words for BlackBckgrd.ini" below (I use the first one).
** https://lnkd.in/e4nEZuzZ

* 2 - Find the SecureCRT's Configuration folder. You can find the path to Config folder on Options / Global Options and navigate to the Configuration paths category.
* 3 - Open the "Keywords" subfolder found in Configuration folder.
PS: If a "Keywords" subfolder doesn't exist in Config folder, create one there.
* 4 - Copy the downloaded .ini file to "Keywords" folder.
* 5 - Edit the session options for any of your saved sessions. Go to category Terminal -> Appearance and in the "Keyword Highlighting" you'll see a drop-down "Name"... and now with "Cisco Words" in it.
PS: You may edit the Default session to configure for all existing and future sessions/connections.


# Console
I use Windows 10 as my main operating system.  I use Cmder  Windows Terminal because the default command prompt isn’t very useful. Cmder uses ConEmu under the hood and allows you to open tabs for the Windows command prompt, Git Bash, WSL Bash, and PowerShell.

Windows Terminal supports the Windows command prompt, Powershell, and WSL Bash. That’s everything I need.

# Editor:
Visual Studio Code: I use this for most of my work, including:
Python development
Docker
Kubernetes
Ansible
AWS CloudFormation
Sublime Text: I use this whenever I want to write something down quickly, and I don’t want to get distracted by everything Visual Studio Code shows by default.
Notepad++: Simple, free, and it works. I use this as a replacement for Sublime Text.

# Apps
TextExpander: this tool is great for reducing the amount you type. It allows you to type abbreviations that automatically expand into whatever you need. Canned responses, URLs, etc. I use this to write quickly but also to open URLs that are difficult to remember (I don’t use bookmarks).
Autohotkey: Similar to TextExpander but free and even more powerful.
Obsidian: This tool allows you to create notes and link them to each other. I use this to create a Zettelkasten containing my notes about networking, documentation, research, and more.
Raindrop.io: I use this as an alternative to Pocket. With Raindrop, you can store articles, images, and videos that you want to read or watch later.
Instapaper: I use this as an alternative to Raindrop because it synchronizes with Readwise.
Readwise: this is a great tool because it synchronizes with Obsidian.

# Recording
OBS Studio: this is what I use to record videos. Open-source and allows you to create scenes.
Shure SM7B Microphone: one of the most popular microphones out there. Sounds great out of the box, even if you don’t edit your audio.
Sennheiser MKH 416: a shotgun overhead microphone that remains outside of the scene I shoot.
Focusrite 2i2: connects the microphone to my computer.

# Labs
Cisco VIRL: I use this for most of my labs.
Cisco CML: Aka VIRL2
EVE-NG: Great for everything that is difficult to do with CML. For example, Cisco SD-WAN.
Physical Lab: I also have a physical lab with routers, switches, firewalls, ESXi servers, etc. You can find some details here.
